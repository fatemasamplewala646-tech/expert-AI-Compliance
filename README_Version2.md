Welcome — this repository contains projects and artifacts demonstrating practical AI governance, compliance, and model risk work.

## About me

## Quick guide
This repo is organized as follows:

## How I work
- I focus on building reproducible compliance artifacts: model cards, datasheets, PIAs, risk assessments, and runbooks.
- For technical projects I provide notebooks or scripts to reproduce results; for governance I provide templates and SOPs.
- Each project folder includes a short README with: problem statement, my role, approach, artifacts, and outcome.

## How to review
1. Start with `projects/01-model-governance/README.md` for governance overview.
2. Watch the demo in `projects/02-model-card-datasheet/` for a quick walkthrough.
3. Check `templates/` for reusable artifacts you can adapt.

## Goals for this portfolio
- Show the ability to operationalize AI governance and compliance.
- Provide clear, reproducible artifacts that demonstrate risk awareness and mitigation.
- Offer a balanced mix of policy work and technical evidence (analysis, tests, or dashboards).
